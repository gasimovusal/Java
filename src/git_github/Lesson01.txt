STEP 1: Create a project on intelJ

----------------------

STEP 2: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY

---------------------
STEP 3: PUSH THE FIRST CODE TO GUTHUB
*Open intellij terminal
*Then follow the instruction on github!!!!
        *git init
        : Done only once for each project.This is used for initilizing the project. This will create .git forlder to store the project versions!!!
NOTE: If you see :  The term 'git' is not recognized --> It means github installation is not complete

        *git add .
        : Done after each code change.
        : Adds the code in the staging area
        *git commit -m "my first commit"
        : Done after each code change
        : This is used for creating new version of the project
        *git branch -M main
        :Done once for each project
        *git remote add origin https://github.com/abayramus/my-first-git-repo.git
        :Done once for each project
        *git push -u origin main
        :Done once for each project
***If your code is successfully pushed, then you should refresh your github and see your code in github
DONE*****

*********Git Push Practice*********
After the first push, we do not use some of the git commets that we used in the first commit.
Go to your class and then push this code to the same repository

    *git add .
    *git commit -m "second commit"
    *git push

***********************************************

HOW TO PULL THE CODE FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL COMPUTER
*Create a new file : test_file.txt
In intelliJ terminal write below commend to pull the code
    *git pull
***USEFULL COMMANDS:
git status :
This is our friend
We see the status of our codes
We can use this anytime to see where you are
