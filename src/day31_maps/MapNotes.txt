Map - Interface
    HashMap - class
    MashTable - class
    TreeMap - class

Keys cannot be repeated but values can be repeated

Thread - means operations

    HashMap
1) it is not synchronized - not capable to control access of multiple threads
2) it is not thread-safe
3) it is faster
4) can have 1 null key and multiple null values
5) it is not ordered

    HashTable
1) it is synchronized - capable to control access of multiple threads
2) it is thread-safe
3) it is slower and safer
4) does not accept any null key or any null value
5) it is not ordered

    TreeMap
1) it is not synchronized - not capable to control access of multiple threads
2) it is not thread-safe
3) it is slowest
4) does not allow null key but allows multiple null values - treemap cannot put null key in order
5) entries sorted according to natural ordering
