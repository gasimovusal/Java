SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
The SDLC aims to produce a high quality software that meets or exceeds customer  expectations, reaches completion within  times and cost estimates.
WinRar - widely used tool for compressing large  files and for transferring data.

    Importance of SDLC
• It provides an effective framework and method to develop software applications.
• It helps in effectively planning before starting the actual development. SDLC allows developers to analyze the requirements.
• It helps in reducing unnecessary costs during development.
• It enables developers to design and build high-quality software products.
• It provides a basis when evaluating the effectiveness of the software. This further enhances the  software product.
• It ensures the protection of software or website

    SDLC Stages:
1) Planning and Requirement analysis
2) Defining Requirements
3) Designing the product architecture
4) Building or developing the product
5) Testing the product
6) Deployment in the market
7) Maintenance

    SDLC Team:
• Project manager
• Business Analyst
• Quality analyst
• Developer

    Project manager
The project manager is  accountable for ensuring  that everyone on the team  knows and executes his or her role, knows the roles of the  other team members
• Managing the project  stakeholders
• Managing communication
• Managing the project team
• Managing the project risk
• Managing the project schedule
• Managing the project budget
• Managing the project conflicts
• Managing the project delivery

    Business Analyst
• A bridge between the business problems  and the technology solutions.
• Requirements management and communication.
• Translating and simplifying requirements.
• Creates Business Requirement Document  (BRD) - what must be delivered to provide  value.
• Create Functional Requirement Document  (FRD) - defines a function of a system or its  component.
• Creates use cases after gathering and  validating a set of functional requirements.
• Creates flow chart of the processes.
• A Business Analyst is someone who  analyzes an organization and designs its processes

    Developer
Developer is a person who writes computer software. As we understand they develop the codes.
Responsibilities:
• Gather customer software requirements and develop related software applications and programs.
• Develop and write high quality coding that meets customer requirements.
• Create software documentation and update existing documentation.

    Quality Analyst
• A software quality analyst is responsible for applying the principles and practices of software quality assurance throughout the software development life cycle.
• A quality analyst helps ensure that an organization’s products or services meet its quality standards.
• The quality analyst (QA) is in charge of ensuring that the application is built according to the plan.
• The analyst is in charge of testing the applications to ensure that the application will work according to the expectation of users and businesses.
• The errors in the application should be found by the analyst so that software developers could work on the errors until the application works without any difficulty.
• Aside from testing if the application is actually working, the quality analyst should also ensure that stages in developing the application are followed.
• Testing is used to detect errors in a product.
Roles and Responsibilities:
• Analyzing client requirements
• Understand the software application being  tested
• Prepare test plan and test strategy Preparing test scenarios / test cases  Preparing test data (used for test cases) Executing the test cases
• Defect tracking
• Perform necessary retesting
• Providing defect information (for developers)
• Preparing report summaries
• Conducting review meetings within the team
