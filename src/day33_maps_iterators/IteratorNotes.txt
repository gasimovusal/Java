Iterators: we use to make modifications on caollections for mutiple data
Collection: Lists, Sets, and so on

• hasNext() ==> checks the condition from elements of collection

• next() ==> gets elements 1 by 1

• hasPrevious() ==> checks the elements start from the last index, true or false

• previous() ==> get the previous element

• remove() ==> delete the current element

• next vs hasNext ==> next return the element, but hasNext returns true or false if element exists or not

• hasPrevious vs previous ==> ot returns true or false if the element from last index exists,
                            but previous will take the last index and give element from last going through first


• When we use Iterator, we will NOT have hasPrevious or previous methods

• we can use ListIterator only with list in Java, but Iterator can be used for all collections

ListIterator ==> it is applicable only for LIST
methods we can use: hasNext, next, hasPrevious, previous, remove, set

Iterator ==> it is applies to collections
methods we can use: hasNext, next, remove
