    1) Head of the LinkedList only contains the address of the 1st element of the list

    2) The last element of the LinkedList contains null in the pointer part of the node because it is the end of the list so it does not point to anything

    3) Every element is a separate object with a data part and address part (it will make operation harder and slower)

    4) The elements are linked using pointers and addresses

    5) Each element is knows as a NODE

    6) It is more DYNAMIC than arrays and EASY to insert and delete elements. Therefore, they are preferred over the arrays

    7) DISADVANTAGES: Nodes cannot be accessed directly
        instead we need to start from the head and follow through the link to reach to a node we want to access
