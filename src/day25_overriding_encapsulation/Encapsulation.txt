•  encapsulation means "data hiding"

•  how to hide data?
     answer: I make the data private

•  can you read encapsulated data from other classes?
     answer: yes I create "getter method" (Java Bean) for the encapsulated data, then by using the getter method I can read it

•  can you update encapsulated data from other classes?
     answer: yes I create "setter method" (Java Bean) for the encapsulated data, then by using the setter method I can update it

•  return type of getter() method must be same with the data type of the variable
   return type of setter() methods will be void every time

•  getter() method do not use any parameter but setter() method use a single parameter whose data type is same with the data type of the variable

•  getter() methods for booleans start with "is", does not start with "get"

•  If you do not want to make your variable value readable, do not create getter method
   If you do not want to update variable value readable, do not create setter

•  just private variables can be encapsulated

•  static variables cannot be encapsulated because static things are common for all objects

•  return type of getter must be same with data type of variable

•  return type of setters must be VOID every time

       NOTE: if you do more create ant setter for any variable, then class is called "immutable class"
