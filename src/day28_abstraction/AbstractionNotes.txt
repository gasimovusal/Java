    4 principles of OOP concept in  Java
    1) Inheritance - parent-child relationship
    2) polymorphism - multi form of objects
    3) encapsulation - hiding the data
    4) abstraction - you hide the implementation
                            //reference type       //object
    example to polymorphism: Animal animal    =     new Cat();


    to create abstract class, use "abstract" keyword between access modifier and the class keyword
    abstract class cannot be instantiated, you are not allowed to create an object
    you can only create object in Concrete Class, which is regular class

    NOTE: A method without body (no implementation) is known as abstract method

    NOTE: An abstract method must always be declared in an abstract class
          If class has abstract method, then the class should be declared abstract as well
          An abstract class may have both abstract methods and concrete methods

    NOTE: if super class has abstract methods, then concrete subclass has to implement/override them
          if super class has abstract methods and child class is abstract as well, no need to override abstract methods

    NOTE: Difference between an abstract class and a concrete class:
          a) abstract class cannot create any object, concrete class can have objects
          b) abstract class can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods, concrete class can have only concrete methods
          c) abstract class cannot be private because it cannot be inherited
          d) abstract method cannot be final or private
                final variable cannot be changed, final method cannot be overridden
          e) abstract method cannot be static because we cannot overwrite it
