    1) explain main() method in Java

        - main method is the block where we run our code
        - it is one of the most important methods in java
        - it is like an engine
        - we can nor tun our programs without main method
        - we cannot overload main method
        - it is must for execution

    2) what kind of data types we have in Java?

        - we have primitive and non-primitive data types
        - primitives are created by java, we cannot create any primitive data type
        - primitive data types ==> int, short, long, byte, double, boolean, char, float
        - they are stored in stack memory, they have just values inside it
        - Non-Primitive data types can be created by programmers. ex: String, Arrays...
        - they have values and methods inside it, and they stored in heap memory

    3) what is String?

        - String is Java class and every Java class can be used as data type
        - we can create String to store a sequence of characters
        - it is non-primitive data type
        - we use " " to assign a value to String
        - String is immutable
        - String has value and many useful methods inside it

    4) what is the purpose of having wrapper class in Java?

        - we do not have any useful method for primitive ones, Java created Wrapper class
        - we can use wrapper class with methods
                boolean ==> Boolean
                char ==> Character
                byte ==> Byte
                short ==> Short
                int ==> Integer
                long ==> Long
                float ==> Float
                double ==> Double

    5) what are if-else statements in Java and what are they used for?

        - if we need an action under condition, we can use if-else statement
        - it will execute a code block if the condition is true and it will execute another code block is the condition is false
        - Structure is if(){}

    6) what are the variable types?

        - local ==> variables are created in the methods. we can only use it inside the methods
        - instance(object) ==> we create instance variables inside the class outside any methods
                           ==> instance variable can be used outside the class by using objects
        - static(class) ==> used for common issues, no need to create an object, all changes can be seen

    7) what is the advantages of using methods in java

        - main advantage is code re-usability. we can create a methods ones and call it when we need it
        - it makes main method more readable and clear.
        - if I call method more than once, its better to create another method and call it

    8) what is the method signature? which methods are same according to java

        - the name of method and the parameters
        - if the method signature (name and parameters) is the same, then java accepts them as same

    9) what is the differences between method overloading and method overriding

        - overloading is changing the parameters, in overriding we cannot touch the signature
        - private, static, and final methods cannot be overridden
        - overriding + overloading = polymorphism

    10) what is constructor?
        - it is a code block to create object from classes
        - constructor is a constructor
        - it should be same with class names
        - we can call constructor from different class
        - we can use parameters inside the constructor

    11) what are the differences between methods and constructors?

        - constructors do not have any return types but methods should have
        - methods can have any name but constructor must be same with class name
        - constructors are called automatically when a new object is created
        - methods are called by class name or by object
        - Java creates default constructor for every class

    12) wht is mutable and immutable in Java?

        - mutable value changes without assigning ==> String builder
        - immutable ==> value does not change without assigning ==> String

    13) what are the differences between throw and throws keyword

        - throw is used in method body, throws is used in method signature
        - after trows you can use multiple Exception class names but after throw you can use new keyword and the constructor of exception class
        - throws can be used just once, throw key word can be used multiple times in method body
